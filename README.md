# NowNow #
NowNow is an iOS tweak enabling you to launch the Google Search app and begin listening for voice queries immediately. This is especially useful for older devices that don't support Siri, as Google's new Voice Search can perform many of the same tasks.

NowNow is invoked via an Activator method, chosen in Settings. A Short Hold or Long Hold method is recommended.

The Google Search app must be installed to use NowNow. If not installed, it will prompt you to open the App Store and do so when invoked.

(The name NowNow is derived from Google's Android term for their voice search, Google Now.)

Available in Cydia on the BigBoss repo.
